# Hello, World! 👋 I'm David Nguyen!

I'm a **Computer Science (B.S.)** and **Economics (B.A.)** double major at **The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill**, with a minor in **Data Science**. From May 2023 to August 2023, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at **VNG Corporation** - one of the largest tech companies in Vietnam and in Asia, and I specialized in full-stack web development and video-streaming platform development for the company. This was also my most recent work experience. Feel free to visit my portfolio website at https://hoangsonww.github.io/My-Portfolio-Website/!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the RecipeGenie Database, the MovieVerse Database, the CommunitySphere social media, the WeatherMate App, and the StickyNotes App.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI & Machine Learning, my goal is to implement a chatbot feature in all of my projects!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Open-Source Projects. I'm also working as a software engineering intern at VNG Corporation.
- 💬 Ask me anything about Front-End Development. I'm also a huge fan of the React framework!
- 📫 How to reach me via email: snghoang@unc.edu, shn21@case.edu, or hoangson091104@gmail.com. (The third email address is preferred.)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His.
